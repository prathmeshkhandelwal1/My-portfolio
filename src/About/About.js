They really helped me in getting motivated and made me realize that how it is super important to never give up on things which really matters to us and always keep trying harder than the last time and give our best shot. Btw my fav one is Naruto.</p>

Been here for over an year now, I tried a lot of things and got interested in web development(mainly Javascript based). I also worked here on many group projects and many of my personal projects ( some of them you could find here in project section ).
